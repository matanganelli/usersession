🔐 Login Page — HTML, CSS & JavaScript

A simple and modern login page built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, focusing on clean structure, good styling practices, and correct usage of let and const.

This project was created for learning purposes, demonstrating how frontend components interact in a real-world scenario.

✨ Features

📄 Semantic HTML structure

🎨 Modern and responsive CSS (gradient + glassmorphism style)

🧠 JavaScript logic with best practices (const and let)

🔐 Basic login validation (mocked credentials)

💬 Dynamic feedback messages (success / error)

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 — page structure

CSS3 — layout, styling, animations

JavaScript (ES6+) — DOM manipulation and logic

🧠 JavaScript Concepts Applied
const

Used for elements and values that do not change:

const loginButton = document.getElementById("loginButton");

let

Used for values that change over time, such as user input:

let email = emailInput.value;
let password = passwordInput.value;


Rule of thumb:
Use const by default. Use let only when reassignment is necessary.

🔑 Test Credentials

Use the following credentials to test the login:

Email: test@email.com

Password: 123456
